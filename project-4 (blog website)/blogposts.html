        <div class="para-content">
            <p class="para-p">If you want to become a developer, you need to decide which programming language you're going to learn. There are a lot of differing opinions about where to start, so we wanted to help you figure out what works best given your goals and experience. We're here to provide actionable advice, not high-level opinions that don't help you get coding. So let's get into it and start breaking down the most in-demand programming languages.</p>
            <div class="content-1">
                <h2>Ruby</h2>
            <p>This is a popular choice and a really good option to choose for a first programming language. Ruby is used by companies like AirBnB, BaseCamp, Groupon and GitHub.

                The learning curve to master Ruby is less steep in comparison to other languages. After a short time, you'll be able to write and execute Ruby programs. It's a great springboard to learning other languages later on at an accelerated pace.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-1">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>A lot of coding bootcamps teach JavaScript. It's definitely an important language to learn, as it's widely used across the web and enables you to do some pretty cool things as a programmer. However, you should know that JavaScript has a number of complicated features - things like anonymous functions, callbacks, and prototypical inheritance - that make it a good choice to learn once you've mastered a different programming language.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-1">
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>Python has become popular in data science and scientific computing. IT's used at companies like Google and Yahoo! Python's syntax looks very similar to Ruby, so if you learn one language it's pretty easy to pick up the other.</p>
